          <Tool title="14‚Äù MacBook Pro, M1 Pro, 16GB RAM (2021)">
            Previously I was using an M1 Mac Mini with 8GB RAM. It handled everything like a champ but I needed something more modular for travel. I still keep the mini around and frequently use it as a lab machine for testing. In the next year or so I hope to replace it with a 16‚Äù M4 Max.

          <Tool title=" 2 MSI 27‚Äù WQHD IPS Nvidia G-Sync Gaming Monitors">
          170Hz refresh rate, One in a horizontal orientation and the other in a vertical orientation. These monitors serve as my primary screens for work and play. They also tend to come with me when I travel because everyone knows one screen is not enough.

          <Tool title="SteelSeries APEX Pro TKL(2023) | SteelSeries APEX Pro Mini">
            I prefer the TKL form factor for the ease of navigation with arrow keys. But on occastion the 60% comes out of hiding. I like the SteelSeries for versatility of connection options Bluetooth/Wired/Wireless. They also are a close second to the Wooting for speed and adjustibility. That being said now that a TKL Wooting is available my SteelSeries might be collecting dust soon.

          <Tool title="SteelSeries Aerox 9 | SteelSeries Aerox 5">
            I selected these mice because of how comfortable they felt in my hand. As someone who has a big hand with long fingers these were some of the only mice that fit my hands. They are starting to show their age though and I am starting to explore the market to find a mouse with a 4000Hz-8000Hz polling rate as they become more widely available.

          <Tool title="Generic Office Chair">
            I have had this thing for ever and it works for the most part.Though I do have my gripes, like comfort. I had briefly tried to upgrade to a Staples Emerge Vortex gaming chair but the quality was terrible and it broke several times, forcing me to return to the standard office chair.

            A terminal for MacOS written in Rust with AI, The regular terminal probably works just as good but this makes me feel cool.

          <Tool title="Beekeeper Studio">
            My favorite DB tool is DataGrip from Jetbrains but Beekeeper is free, works well, and looks pretty, so for now its the DB tool of choice.
